1. 3.cpp?
2. 7.cpp
why doesn't "//cout <<* it<<endl; //won't work"?
does cpp output string work very different than python output stream?
3. m.insert(make_pair("wario", "purpllle"));
this doesn't work if wario key already exists in the map. But m["wario"]="something" still works. Can overwrite the value. m.insert doesn't?
